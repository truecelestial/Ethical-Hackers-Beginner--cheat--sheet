Although i have spent just a little time, with practical experiences in the cyber-security field some times, i forget my commands or i do not remenber them completey which can be embarassing and frustrating, so i thought why not have a centralised place where all commands are, so that for intermediate and especially beginners they can easily view these codes and use them for penetration tests and cyber security tasks, please if you have any suggestions please do well to make them, i am in no way an expert just a begineer that knows a thing or two......Happy Hacking.
